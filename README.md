Mechanical Systems Simulator / Simulador de Sistemas Mec√°nicos

This project is already being used by the departmen of Mechanical Engineering at the Superior Technical School of Seville, belonging to the University of Seville as a support to education.

The goal of this project is to be able to show data about the movement of a mechanical system and to simulate it graphically. I've become serious about this and I want to make this program much better.

This simulator works by adding the final variables of any mechanical system in order to take it to its equivalent trolley system with a spring and a shock-absorber.
